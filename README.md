# odin-recipes
HTML practice project from TOP. There is a home page with links to additional
pages containing fun recipes.

## Skills Practiced
- Using HTML to create webpages
- Utilizing multiple levels of heading tags
- Creating links using the <a> tag to navigate pages
- Adding images to pages using the <img> tag
- Structuring unordered and ordered lists
- Practicing writing concise yet detailed commit messages through a text editor

## Reflection
1. This project was completed mostly as a review of HTML after taking
approximately 9 months off from coding.
2. I was able to fly through the lessons on The Odin Project and complete this
project quickly.
3. The review will be a good launching pad for future projects so that I do not
get stuck looking up a lot of trivial HTML and Git concepts/commands.
4. I learned that I can write longer and detailed commit messages through the
text editor. I believe this will be an important documentation skill.
5. I should continue to commit often as I did on this project. It will help
greatly with documentation of projects and allow me to go back in the history
of the code if I need to revert due to major bugs.
