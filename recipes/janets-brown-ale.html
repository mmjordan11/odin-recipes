      <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
      <p>
        Janet’s Brown Ale has quite the pedigree. Mike “Tasty” McDole took home a
        medal when this recipe won gold in the Brown Ale category in the National
        Homebrew Competition (NHC) in 2004. The award-winning recipe was then
        featured in Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer’s book, Brewing Classic
        Styles, as an example of a bigger, hoppier American Brown Ale. In 2009,
        McDole took gold again at the NHC with an updated recipe that he
        categorized as Imperial Brown Ale, but this time in the Specialty Beers
        category. Though Janet’s Brown Ale deviates a bit from the style
        guidelines for a traditional American Brown Ale, surely you will not be
        upset by the higher IBUs and ABV after taking a sip!
