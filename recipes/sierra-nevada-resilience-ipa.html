      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Camp Fire--the most devastating wildfire in California's history--
        has hit close to home for Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. While the Chico
        brewery was spared, many of Sierra Nevada's employees, patrons and
        neighbors lost everything as the Camp Fire ravaged northern Californian.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help raise much needed support for the recovery efforts, Sierra
        Nevada has created a beer called Resilience IPA. Sierra Nevada, along
        with many of its professional brewing peers, will be brewing and selling
        Resilience IPA with all proceeds donated to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire
        Relief Fund through Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is our hope that homebrewers will make a batch of Resilience IPA in
        solidarity with Sierra Nevada and pro breweries across the country. While
        we can't sell our creations and donate the proceeds, please consider
        donating to the Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation if you are able.

    <ol>
      <li>Mash grains at 152°F (66.7°C) for 60 minutes.</li>
      <li>If including a mash out step, raise temperature to 168°F (75.6°C) and
        hold for ten minutes.</li>
      <li>Sparge with 168°F (75.6°C) water to collect 6.53 gallons (24.7

      <li>At flameout, stir wort to cool slightly and add whirlpool hops.</li>

      <li>Add dry hops towards the end of active fermentation, when specific
        gravity is around 1.020–1.024 (5.1–6.1°P).</li>
      <li>Let rest for four days or until fermentation is complete.</li>
      <li>Cold crash to drop hops out of suspension.</li>
